HCAI (Human Centered AI) reframes AI by replacing algorithms and AI systems with humans at the centre. Instead of humans being in the loop around AI, HCAI suggests that AI is in the loop around humans, who now are the center of attention. 

HCAI's design thinking approach puts users at the center emphasizing user experience design, measuring human performance focusing on user needs, explainable systems and meaningful human control.

Here is a potential governance structure for Human Centered AI

This allows software and organizational leaders to develop HCAI products and services that are driven by 3 goals

1. Reliable systems based on proven SWE practices
2. Safety culture through business management strategies
3. Trustworthy certifications
