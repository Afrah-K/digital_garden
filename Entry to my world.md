Hello there! Welcome to my digital garden. I document all of my learnings here. Think of this as a mini portfolio + with an added second brain.

### A little bit about me.
I love the world of startups and with a Bachelors degree in Computer Engineering, tech ones specifically. I'm building Riko Labs, an AI startup creating human centric safety intelligence for AI models. Apart from that, I work as a Data Scientist and CTO at Kindpath Health based in Boston.

### What I do.
I love AI. To the point of obsession. As much as I love humans. So I founded a research lab + AI safety layer. I've written a few papers in the AI development field and my upcoming focus would be to center it towards human design. Think of what I do as an Intersection between humans and AI.

### Jack of all, master of none.
I do multiple things at once. Always have been and always will. This allows me to be a multi faceted player weaving connections between worlds that seem disconnected. Ever thought genshin impact would help me build a startup? I do and its working.
